This program implements a non-starving Read/Write process. The program ensures that only once writer is in execution, all other threads must wait.
On the other hand, if a reader is executing, other reader are allowed to run.

To run the program, use the "make" command.

or u can use gcc -o rwmain main.c readerwriter.c -lpthread
as an alternative to "make"

Once compiled, run ./rwmain to execute the program.

An additional command "make clean" can be used to remove all the ".o" files and the "main" file.
